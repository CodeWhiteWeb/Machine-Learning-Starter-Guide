### 1.1.4. **Data Preprocessing:**
- Handle null values.
- Standardize data.
- Deal with categorical values and perform one-hot encoding.
- Apply feature scaling.

### 1.1.5. **Machine Learning Libraries:**
- Get familiar with popular libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **TensorFlow**.

### 1.1.6. **Practical Experience:**
- Participate in Kaggle competitions and practice on real-world datasets.
- Explore projects on GitHub for learning from others' code.
